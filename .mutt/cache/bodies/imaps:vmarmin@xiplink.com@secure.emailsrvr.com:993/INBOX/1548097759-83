Via the EToSat list, two papers evaluating QUIC performance over satellite:

Google QUIC performance over a public SATCOM access
https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.04970.pdf

Satellite Internet Performance Measurements
http://www7content.cs.fau.de/~deutschmann/NetSys2019_preprint.pdf

Both conclude that PEPs are essential for good satellite performance, 
handily beating QUIC, especially for large (several MB) transfers.

(The second paper is only 4 pages and worth a quick look.  It 
anonymously compares protocol performance among 3 satellite operators, 
one of whom "shows more stable performance regarding delays, data rates 
and page load times."  I wonder which operator that is, and if we're 
embedded with them! :) )
